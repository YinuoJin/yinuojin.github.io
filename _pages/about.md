- I'm a fourth-year CS undergraduate student at Columbia University. My research interests lie in Computational Biology, particularly in applying machine learning methods on high-throughput sequencing data to understand the underlying biological questions.

- I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Itsik Pe'er](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/itsik-peer) and [Prof. Elham Azizi](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/faculty/elham-azizi) and have been working on multiple projects in their labs. Before transferring to Columbia, I studied Physics at Colgate University. In Spring 2019, I attended a semester-long CS study abroad program at [AIT-Budapest](https://www.ait-budapest.com/syllabuses/computational-biology-and-medicine) with focus on Compbio, during which I was advised by Prof. Péter Sárközy at [Computational Biomedicine Workgroup](http://bioinformatics.mit.bme.hu/), Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME).
