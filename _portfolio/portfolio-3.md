In this project, I preprocessed and analyzed two sets of scRNA-seq data from healthy mouse & human liver tissues. Differerntially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were selected for clustering and cell-type inference. I applied scVI for dimension reduction and Louvain-based method for clustering. Cell types of each cluster from both datasets were assigned jointly based on canonical marker genes and cluster-wise distance measure. Intercellular Ligand-Receptor interactions between clusters of interest from both datasets are inferred via NicheNet. Our wet lab collaborators are currently designing experiments to further analyze the top-ranked L-R pairs in the mouse dataset inferred from NicheNet.
