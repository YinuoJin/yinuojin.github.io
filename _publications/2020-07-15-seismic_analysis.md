title: "Leveraging USArray and Regional Networks to Characterize Natural and Mining Seismicity at the Intersection of the Grenville and Taconic Provinces"
collection: publications
# permalink: /publication/seismic_analysis
excerpt: 'This study investigates seismicity in upstate New York and surrounding regions, where a combination of complex basement geology, limited numbers of earthquakes, and a vigorous mining industry provide challenges to characterizing seismicity. Using a combination of public seismic networks and private stations in the High Peaks region of the Adirondack Mountains and a two-step location process, a total of 285 events were well-located, including 107 earthquakes and 178 mining events. While a number of waveform and source characteristics were used to differentiate earthquakes from mining events, those that were most useful in this region were emergent P-wave arrivals, low frequencies dominating most records, and long codas (>25 s) for nearby stations.'
